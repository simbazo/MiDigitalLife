	<h3>Philosophy</h3>
	<p>We have chosen the Boabab tree as it represents our values. The roots run deep in creating something that endures. However, as one never really sees the roots, some might be tempted to think what is above the ground represents the majority of the work.  With Boabob trees, the tops look likes the roots, so no one is left uninformed.
	</p>
	<p>Creating technology in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive space requires hiring and retaining skilled people with non-traditional backgrounds &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/top-microsoft-position-for-kzn-man-22-20160328">Top Microsoft position for KZN man (22)</a>. There is no university course for software that is less than 5 years old &ndash; IT ventures are not dependent on graduates. The good news is that even within traditional businesses, the value of degrees is becoming questionable &ndash; see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/07/ernst-and-young-removes-degree-classification-entry-criteria_n_7932590.html">Ernst &amp; Young Removes Degree Classification From Entry Criteria As There’s ‘No Evidence’ University Equals Success</a>.</p>

	<p>We value, pay well, and strive to retain our team for future projects &ndash; that way we all benefit. There are few coders with the skill to implement to newer (and often cheaper and more effective) technology solutions. See <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/11/20/facebook-billionaires-dominate-40-richest-under-40-list/" target="_blank">Facebook billionaires dominate ‘40 richest under 40’ list</a>.
	</p>
	<p>In order to keep pace with technology, we subscribe to agile thinking. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/731247?path=/bmj/347/7922/Feature.full.pdf">Turning doctors in coders</a>. The ecosystem within IT dominant projects can dramatically influence both outcomes AND COST. Going corporate will no longer ensure the viability of your project.</p>

<!-- 
We brought together smart, talented thinkers and unleashed their combined creativity on the world.

We’re fully aware that we’re rattling a few cages. We firmly believe that the best work comes from it — and the people behind it. That’s the thing. They’re our people. Not our staff, our associates, our worker bees, or anything like that. They provide the method to our madness. And their passion and creativity don’t start or stop at our front door. We’ve got educators and artists, writers and speakers — and they’re all thinkers and instigators, 24/7.

With that kind of energy, we don’t do the “lone wolf” thing. Strategy, technology, creativity and tactics all live together. Teamwork is the only way we work.
