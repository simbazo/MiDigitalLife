            <p>Appenberg Digital Publishing was established in November 2014 in response to a growing need amongst publishers of medical information for a mechanism that would make their content available in mobile apps. We set about creating an end-to-end solution to allow content providers to hold, author, update, and review their content in a hosted hybrid application.</p>
            <p>We focus primarily on producing quality clinical documentation. Working in close collaboration with various medical experts, we assist with the generation of procedures, guidelines and formularies for various medical conditions.</p>
            <p>Lead by a medical doctor specialising in clinical pharmacology and backed by a full stack developer and data capturers, we are able to produce and quality check all our production content.</p>
